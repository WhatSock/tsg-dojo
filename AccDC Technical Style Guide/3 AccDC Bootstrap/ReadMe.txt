To enable bootstrapping, the module "accdc_bootstrap.js" must be loaded after all desired Accessible Component Modules have been loaded.

When a control is bootstrapped, there is no setup.js file. All configurations are controlled through HTML5 attributes within the markup and by editing the "accdc_bootstrap.js" file as desired to customize functionality.

Bootstrapping is designed to handle common control types that span multiple pages with similar setup configurations.

View bootstrap examples in the Coding Arena, or read the setup instructions within the AccDC Technical Style Guide to learn how to implement the Bootstrap module.
