Since this implementation is Bootstrapped using the "accdc_bootstrap.js" module, there is no setup.js file. All configurations are controlled through HTML5 attributes within the markup and by editing the "accdc_bootstrap.js" file as desired to customize functionality.

Bootstrapping is designed to handle common control types that span multiple pages with similar setup configurations.

Additional HTML5 attributes can be added to enhance functionality by editing the file "accdc_bootstrap.js".
