This is a simple demo that shows how the $A.announce() method can be used to announce important information for screen reader users.

Important: $A.announce() should be used sparingly, and not for everything.

When too many things are announced on the same page, it is difficult for screen reader users to differentiate between what is being announced, and what is being navigated using the arrow keys. This is because the same voice is used for both, with no distinction.
