<!-- To ensure keyboard accessibility, an active element such as an A tag or Button tag should be used as the triggering element.

Required class:
"accMenu" : Specifies a menu triggering element to be configured by the Bootstrap module.

Attributes explained:
• data-src : The resource path and pointer to the ID attribute of the top level menu list.
If pointing to a menu list within the same document, only the ID attribute should be included here. 
• data-internal : The ID attribute of the container element for all menu lists within the same document.
If data-src is set to an external source, data-internal should be blank or not included. 
• data-role : The role name that is conveyed to screen reader users at the beginning and end of each menu section. "Menu" is set by default if no value
is specified. 
• data-starttext : The role state that is conveyed to screen reader users at the beginning of each menu section. "Start" is set by default if no value is
specified. 
• data-endtext : The role state that is conveyed to screen reader users at the end of each menu section. "End" is set by default if no value is specified.
• data-openstate : The open state text that is conveyed to screen reader users within the triggering link when open. "Open" is set by default if no value
is specified. 
• data-containerclass : The class name that will be added dynamically to the surrounding Div tag for each menu group when rendered. "menu" is set by default
if no value is specified. 
• data-menutag : The tag name for the container element that contains all menu item tags. All menu item tags must be contained within this container element,
even if they are not first level child nodes. "ol" is set by default if no value is specified. 
• data-menuclass : The shared class name that is contained within every menu container element. All menu tags specified by data-menutag must include this
class name. "menu" is set by default if no value is specified. 
• data-menuitemtag : The shared tag name that specifies all menu item tags. All menu item tags must be contained within the container element specified
by data-menutag, even if they are not first level child nodes. "a" is set by default if no value is specified. 
• data-menufolderclass : The shared class name that is contained within every menu tag that opens a submenu. "submenu" is set by default if no value is
specified. 
• data-menulinkclass : The shared class name that is contained within every menu tag that does not open a submenu. "link" is set by default if no value
is specified. 
• data-flyout="true" : Specifies a horizontal flyout menu where the Left and Right arrow keys will be used to navigate menu item nodes, and Up and Down
will be used to close or open submenus. If data-flyout is not included within the markup, the default vertically oriented keyboard assignments will be
applied automatically.
