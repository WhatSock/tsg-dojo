Simply use CSS to set the size of the slider, and the height and width of the container element, and then the slider will configure itself using these offsets.

Since repetitive labels are used, and the textual slider icon has no value for screen reader users, aria-hidden="true" is used to hide them from screen reader users.

Don't include any other ARIA attributes however, the Slider module handles this automatically.  

The slide icon can be changed to anything, or an image or CSS background image can be used instead, and the styling can be configured for any layout, and it will still be accessible for screen reader and keyboard only users.
